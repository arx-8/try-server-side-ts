# Pros/Cons

## Pros

- minimum deps. only parcel and nodemon.
- 1 dist/index.js includes node_modules.

## Cons

- node_modules cannot exec minify
  - package.json / targets.main.minify option is not working.
- nest.js cannot support?
  - In the case of nest.js, there is a dependency that for some reason requires additional installation.
  - In other words, even express.js may hit a case that does not work someday.
- parcel is not support jest
  - should use vitest or something
